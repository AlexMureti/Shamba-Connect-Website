This comprehensive guide will walk you through every step of the process.\n\n## Choosing Your Location\n\nThe first step is selecting the right spot for your garden. Look for an area that receives at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. Good drainage is essential - avoid areas where water pools after rain.\n\n## Soil Preparation\n\nHealthy soil is the foundation of a productive garden. Test your soil pH (ideal range is 6.0-7.0) and add organic matter like compost to improve structure and fertility.\n\n## Selecting Your Vegetables\n\nFor beginners in Nairobi, start with these easy-to-grow vegetables:\n\n**Leafy Greens**: Kales (sukuma wiki), spinach, and lettuce thrive in our climate.\n\n**Root Vegetables**: Carrots, beetroot, and radishes are excellent choices.\n\n**Fruiting Vegetables**: Tomatoes, bell peppers, and eggplants do well with proper care.\n\n## Ongoing Care\n\nWater your garden consistently, preferably in the morning. Mulch around plants to conserve moisture and suppress weeds. Monitor for pests and address issues promptly using organic methods.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith patience and consistent care, your kitchen garden will provide fresh, nutritious vegetables for your family.

Here are five vegetables that consistently perform well in our region.\n\n## 1. Kales (Sukuma Wiki)\n\nKenya's favorite leafy green is incredibly well-suited to Nairobi's climate. Plant year-round and harvest leaves regularly to encourage continuous growth.\n\n## 2. Tomatoes\n\nChoose varieties suited to cooler highlands. Provide support structures and protect from late blight during rainy seasons.\n\n## 3. Carrots\n\nPlant in loose, deep soil. They prefer cooler weather and take 2-3 months from seed to harvest.\n\n## 4. Bell Peppers\n\nThese love Nairobi's moderate temperatures. Give them plenty of sun and consistent watering for best results.\n\n## 5. Spinach\n\nFast-growing and nutrient-packed, spinach thrives in Nairobi's cooler nights.

They require minimal space and investment.\n\n## Housing Requirements\n\nConstruct well-ventilated hutches elevated off the ground. Each rabbit needs minimum 4 square feet of space. Provide shelter from rain and direct sun.\n\n## Feeding\n\nRabbits thrive on a diet of quality hay, fresh greens, and rabbit pellets. Always provide clean water. Common greens include kales, carrot tops, and napier grass.\n\n## Breeding\n\nDoes (females) can breed at 5-6 months, bucks (males) at 6-7 months. Gestation period is 28-32 days. A doe can produce 6-8 litters per year.\n\n## Health Management\n\nVaccinate against common diseases. Keep hutches clean and dry. Monitor for signs of illness like loss of appetite or discharge from eyes/nose.\n\n## Market Potential\n\nRabbit meat is lean, healthy, and in growing demand. Establish relationships with hotels, restaurants, and health-conscious consumers.`,\n    category: \"Rabbit Farming\",\n    author: \"Mercy Munene\",\n    date: \"Jan 5, 2024\",\n    featuredImage: \"/healthy-rabbits-in-modern-farming-setup-with-hutch.jpg\",\n    slug: \"rabbit-farming-101\",\n    published: true,\n    views: 312,\n    readTime: \"6 min read\",\n  },\n  {\n    id: \"4\",\n    title: \"Natural Pest Control Methods for Organic Gardens\",\n    excerpt:\n      \"Say no to chemicals with these effective organic pest control methods.

Organic pest control is safer, sustainable, and effective.\n\n## Companion Planting\n\nPlant marigolds near tomatoes to repel aphids. Grow basil with peppers to deter thrips. Interplant onions with carrots to confuse carrot flies.\n\n## Natural Sprays\n\n**Neem Oil**: Effective against most common pests. Mix with water and spray weekly.\n\n**Soap Spray**: Mix liquid soap with water to control soft-bodied insects like aphids.\n\n**Garlic-Chili Spray**: Blend garlic and hot peppers with water for a powerful pest deterrent.\n\n## Physical Barriers\n\nUse row covers to protect young plants. Install sticky traps for flying insects. Handpick larger pests like caterpillars.\n\n## Encourage Beneficial Insects\n\nLadybugs eat aphids. Lacewings consume many pest species. Plant flowers like cosmos and zinnias to attract these helpful allies.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOrganic pest control requires observation and patience, but it creates a healthier garden ecosystem that naturally resists pest outbreaks.`,\n    category: \"Organic Practices\",\n    author: \"Agricultural Team\",\n    date: \"Dec 28, 2023\",\n    featuredImage: \"/organic-garden-with-natural-pest-control-companion.jpg\",\n    slug: \"natural-pest-control-methods\",\n    published: true,\n    views: 178,\n    readTime: \"5 min read\",\n  },\n  {\n    id: \"5\",\n    title: \"Success Story: From Zero to Harvest in 60 Days\",\n    excerpt:\n      \"Meet the Wanjiru family who transformed their backyard into a productive garden.

Shamba Connect provided seedlings, training, and ongoing support.\n\n## The Journey\n\n**Week 1-2**: Prepared soil with compost and built raised beds.\n\n**Week 3-4**: Planted kales, spinach, tomatoes, and peppers.\n\n**Week 5-8**: Regular watering, mulching, and pest monitoring.\n\n**Week 9+**: First harvests of leafy greens!\n\n## The Impact\n\n\"Within 60 days, we were eating our own fresh vegetables daily,\" Mrs. Wanjiru beams. \"Our grocery bills dropped significantly, and my children are eating healthier.\"\n\nThe family now saves approximately KES 3,000 monthly on vegetables and has expanded their garden to include herbs and root vegetables.\n\n## Your Turn\n\nThe Wanjiru family's success is not unique.

Simple steps to sustainable soil management and reduce your household waste.\",\n    content: `## Why Compost?\n\nComposting reduces waste, enriches soil, and saves money on fertilizers. It's one of the best things you can do for your garden.\n\n## What to Compost\n\n**Green Materials** (Nitrogen-rich): Fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, fresh grass clippings, green leaves.\n\n**Brown Materials** (Carbon-rich): Dry leaves, shredded paper, cardboard, wood chips.\n\n## What NOT to Compost\n\nAvoid meat, dairy, oils, diseased plants, and pet waste. These attract pests or contain harmful pathogens.\n\n## Building Your Compost Pile\n\n**Layer Method**: Alternate layers of green and brown materials. Keep ratios roughly 1:2 (green:brown).\n\n**Location**: Choose a shaded, well-drained spot near a water source.\n\n**Size**: Minimum 3x3x3 feet for efficient decomposition.\n\n## Maintenance\n\nTurn your pile weekly to aerate. Keep it moist like a wrung-out sponge. Properly maintained compost is ready in 2-3 months.\n\n## Using Your Compost\n\nAdd finished compost to garden beds before planting. Use as mulch around established plants. Mix into potting soil for containers.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Smelly pile**: Too wet or too much green material. Add browns and turn.\n\n**Not decomposing**: Too dry or too much brown material. Add greens and water.`,\n    category: \"Organic Practices\",\n    author: \"Agricultural Team\",\n    date: \"Dec 15, 2023\",\n    featuredImage: \"/compost-bin-with-organic-matter-and-rich-dark-comp.jpg\",\n    slug: \"composting-made-easy\",\n    published: true,\n    views: 201,\n    readTime: \"5 min read\",\n  },\n]\n\nconst getInitialPosts = (): BlogPost[] => {\n  if (typeof window === \"undefined\") return defaultPosts\n\n  const stored = localStorage.getItem(\"shambaConnectBlogPosts\")\n  if (stored) {\n    try {\n      return JSON.parse(stored)\n    } catch {\n      return defaultPosts\n    }\n  }\n\n  // First time - save defaults to localStorage\n  localStorage.setItem(\"shambaConnectBlogPosts\", JSON.stringify(defaultPosts))\n  return defaultPosts\n}\n\ninterface BlogStore {\n  posts: BlogPost[]\n  addPost: (post: Omit<BlogPost, \"id\" | \"views\">) => void\n  updatePost: (id: string, updates: Partial<BlogPost>) => void\n  deletePost: (id: string) => void\n  getPostBySlug: (slug: string) => BlogPost | undefined\n  incrementViews: (slug: string) => void\n}\n\nexport const useBlogStore = create<BlogStore>((set, get) => ({\n  posts: getInitialPosts(),\n\n  addPost: (post) => {\n    const newPost: BlogPost = {\n      ...post,\n      id: Date.now().toString(),\n      views: 0,\n    }\n    set((state) => {\n      const newPosts = [newPost, ...state.posts]\n      if (typeof window !== \"undefined\") {\n        localStorage.setItem(\"shambaConnectBlogPosts\", JSON.stringify(newPosts))\n      }\n      return { posts: newPosts }\n    })\n  },\n\n  updatePost: (id, updates) => {\n    set((state) => {\n      const newPosts = state.posts.map((post) => (post.id === id ?
