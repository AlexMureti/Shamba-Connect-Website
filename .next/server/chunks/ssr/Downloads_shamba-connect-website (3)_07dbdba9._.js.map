This comprehensive guide will walk you through every step of the process.\n\n## Choosing Your Location\n\nThe first step is selecting the right spot for your garden. Look for an area that receives at least 6-8 hours of direct sunlight daily. Good drainage is essential - avoid areas where water pools after rain.\n\n## Soil Preparation\n\nHealthy soil is the foundation of a productive garden. Test your soil pH (ideal range is 6.0-7.0) and add organic matter like compost to improve structure and fertility.\n\n## Selecting Your Vegetables\n\nFor beginners in Nairobi, start with these easy-to-grow vegetables:\n\n**Leafy Greens**: Kales (sukuma wiki), spinach, and lettuce thrive in our climate.\n\n**Root Vegetables**: Carrots, beetroot, and radishes are excellent choices.\n\n**Fruiting Vegetables**: Tomatoes, bell peppers, and eggplants do well with proper care.\n\n## Ongoing Care\n\nWater your garden consistently, preferably in the morning. Mulch around plants to conserve moisture and suppress weeds. Monitor for pests and address issues promptly using organic methods.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nWith patience and consistent care, your kitchen garden will provide fresh, nutritious vegetables for your family.

Plant year-round and harvest leaves regularly to encourage continuous growth.\n\n## 2. Tomatoes\n\nChoose varieties suited to cooler highlands. Provide support structures and protect from late blight during rainy seasons.\n\n## 3. Carrots\n\nPlant in loose, deep soil. They prefer cooler weather and take 2-3 months from seed to harvest.\n\n## 4. Bell Peppers\n\nThese love Nairobi's moderate temperatures. Give them plenty of sun and consistent watering for best results.\n\n## 5. Spinach\n\nFast-growing and nutrient-packed, spinach thrives in Nairobi's cooler nights.

They require minimal space and investment.\n\n## Housing Requirements\n\nConstruct well-ventilated hutches elevated off the ground. Each rabbit needs minimum 4 square feet of space. Provide shelter from rain and direct sun.\n\n## Feeding\n\nRabbits thrive on a diet of quality hay, fresh greens, and rabbit pellets. Always provide clean water. Common greens include kales, carrot tops, and napier grass.\n\n## Breeding\n\nDoes (females) can breed at 5-6 months, bucks (males) at 6-7 months. Gestation period is 28-32 days. A doe can produce 6-8 litters per year.\n\n## Health Management\n\nVaccinate against common diseases. Keep hutches clean and dry. Monitor for signs of illness like loss of appetite or discharge from eyes/nose.\n\n## Market Potential\n\nRabbit meat is lean, healthy, and in growing demand. Establish relationships with hotels, restaurants, and health-conscious consumers.`,\n    category: \"Rabbit Farming\",\n    author: \"Mercy Munene\",\n    date: \"Jan 5, 2024\",\n    featuredImage: \"/healthy-rabbits-in-modern-farming-setup-with-hutch.jpg\",\n    slug: \"rabbit-farming-101\",\n    published: true,\n    views: 312,\n    readTime: \"6 min read\",\n  },\n  {\n    id: \"4\",\n    title: \"Natural Pest Control Methods for Organic Gardens\",\n    excerpt:\n      \"Say no to chemicals with these effective organic pest control methods.

Organic pest control is safer, sustainable, and effective.\n\n## Companion Planting\n\nPlant marigolds near tomatoes to repel aphids. Grow basil with peppers to deter thrips. Interplant onions with carrots to confuse carrot flies.\n\n## Natural Sprays\n\n**Neem Oil**: Effective against most common pests. Mix with water and spray weekly.\n\n**Soap Spray**: Mix liquid soap with water to control soft-bodied insects like aphids.\n\n**Garlic-Chili Spray**: Blend garlic and hot peppers with water for a powerful pest deterrent.\n\n## Physical Barriers\n\nUse row covers to protect young plants. Install sticky traps for flying insects. Handpick larger pests like caterpillars.\n\n## Encourage Beneficial Insects\n\nLadybugs eat aphids. Lacewings consume many pest species. Plant flowers like cosmos and zinnias to attract these helpful allies.\n\n## Conclusion\n\nOrganic pest control requires observation and patience, but it creates a healthier garden ecosystem that naturally resists pest outbreaks.`,\n    category: \"Organic Practices\",\n    author: \"Agricultural Team\",\n    date: \"Dec 28, 2023\",\n    featuredImage: \"/organic-garden-with-natural-pest-control-companion.jpg\",\n    slug: \"natural-pest-control-methods\",\n    published: true,\n    views: 178,\n    readTime: \"5 min read\",\n  },\n  {\n    id: \"5\",\n    title: \"Success Story: From Zero to Harvest in 60 Days\",\n    excerpt:\n      \"Meet the Wanjiru family who transformed their backyard into a productive garden.

It's one of the best things you can do for your garden.\n\n## What to Compost\n\n**Green Materials** (Nitrogen-rich): Fruit and vegetable scraps, coffee grounds, fresh grass clippings, green leaves.\n\n**Brown Materials** (Carbon-rich): Dry leaves, shredded paper, cardboard, wood chips.\n\n## What NOT to Compost\n\nAvoid meat, dairy, oils, diseased plants, and pet waste. These attract pests or contain harmful pathogens.\n\n## Building Your Compost Pile\n\n**Layer Method**: Alternate layers of green and brown materials. Keep ratios roughly 1:2 (green:brown).\n\n**Location**: Choose a shaded, well-drained spot near a water source.\n\n**Size**: Minimum 3x3x3 feet for efficient decomposition.\n\n## Maintenance\n\nTurn your pile weekly to aerate. Keep it moist like a wrung-out sponge. Properly maintained compost is ready in 2-3 months.\n\n## Using Your Compost\n\nAdd finished compost to garden beds before planting. Use as mulch around established plants. Mix into potting soil for containers.\n\n## Troubleshooting\n\n**Smelly pile**: Too wet or too much green material. Add browns and turn.\n\n**Not decomposing**: Too dry or too much brown material. Add greens and water.`,\n    category: \"Organic Practices\",\n    author: \"Agricultural Team\",\n    date: \"Dec 15, 2023\",\n    featuredImage:
